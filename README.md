# SpaceChecker
I'm deciding to make a mini editing program that checks for extra spaces and so forth, mainly to refresh my memory on Java (I know). Also just to do something for fun. Originally had some code that runs a sentence on the shell, but ill modify it overtime so it not only reads files, but also does other stuff possibly too.

edit December 26: Will change to Javascript as I've been learning its more for app/web app development so I'm revisiting this old project and will update it.

Fixed the code where it now accepts a file filled with text rather than pasting a paragraph. Just needs to use the command prompt
