# SpaceChecker
I'm deciding to make a mini editing program that checks for extra spaces and so forth, mainly to refresh my memory on Java (I know). Also just to do something for fun. Originally had some code that runs a sentence on the shell, but ill modify it overtime so it not only reads files, but also does other stuff possibly too

Fixed the code where it now accepts a file filled with text rather than pasting a paragraph. Just needs to use the command prompt
